# Parpera backend engineering test

This repo contains my implementation of a solution to the Parpera backend engineering test. It consists of a RESTful API with two endpoints for the `Transaction` resource.

## Overview

A `Transaction` has five properties:

```csharp
Id (Integer)
CreatedAt (DateTime)
Description (String)
Amount (Decimal)
Status (Enum[Cancelled, Completed, Pending])
```

The two API endpoints allow for:

- viewing all the `Transaction`s in reverse chronological order (`GET /api/Transaction`), and
- updating a `Transaction`'s `Status` property (`PATCH /api/Transaction/{id}`)

## Project structure

The two main directories are:

- `src`: contains the application source files
- `tests`: contains the tests for the application (**_still to be added_**)

## Setup instructions

Install the .NET 6.0 SDK - specifically make sure you have .NET 6.0.1 and ASP.NET Core 6.0.1 installed. While the project may be comptabile with older versions of .NET, this has not been checked.

Once .NET is installed:

- clone the repo to your local computer
- `cd` into the `src` directory
- run `dotnet run` - this will install project dependencies, build the project, seed the database, and run the project

How you access the API endpoints will depend on whether you have set up [local https certificates](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/additional-tools/self-signed-certificates-guide). If your local https certificates are set up and working, you can access the API via an HTTP client. Alternatively, you can install and use the [`httprepl` CLI tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/web-api/http-repl/?view=aspnetcore-6.0).

You can view the raw, auto-generated OpenAPI Specification (OAS) for the API at `https://localhost:<port>/swagger/v1/swagger.json`, or you can view the Swagger UI version of the OAS at `https://localhost:<port>/swagger`.

## Todos and caveats

- üõ†Ô∏è Tests still need to be added.
- If I had more time I would add stricter validations that prevented incorrect values possibly being captured for `Transaction` properties (e.g. integers outside the range of the enum for `Status`).
- I'd like to store the `Status` values in the database as strings rather than numbers so that their database values make sense even if application code is incorrecly changed or the values need to be shared with other services (internal or external).
- I would implement authentication and/or authorisation.
- If the requirement is that it is only the `Status` property that should be able to be updated, I would restrict the update endpoint to reflect this.
- I would look into using async processing.
